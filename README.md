# Wordle Clone
## Second attempt now with JS and CSS

# To Do:
- Select a random word from the word list as a solution
- ~~End the game when the correct word is guessed~~
    - ~~Front end: If the guess is correct show a victory screen~~
    - ~~"Good Job!"~~
- ~~Send response for each other guess~~
    - ~~Incorrect or not complete:~~
        - ~~Front end: Flash message" "Not in word list"~~
        - ~~Front end: Flash message: "Too short"~~
    - ~~Valid Guess:~~
        - ~~Back end: share if in the correct location or in the word~~
        - ~~Front end: color the tile according to the response~~
- CSS and Animation:
    - Basic Layout
    - Animate on type: Quickly increase then decrease size of tile
    - Animate on guess: Flip animation: shrink vertically; change color then grow vertically
    - Animate on invalid guess: shake row side to side
